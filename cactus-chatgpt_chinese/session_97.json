Presenting Problem\nI feel like my entire week is ruined if I don't get to go running, which causes a lot of stress and anxiety in my daily life.\nThese feelings started around a year ago when I began using running as my main coping mechanism.\nThe stress levels have been high, especially on days when I can't go for a run due to work or weather conditions.\nThe problem has escalated, affecting my mood and productivity when I miss a run.\nI experience these feelings multiple times a week, especially when external factors prevent me from running.\nI have tried to manage my anxiety using breathing exercises and mindfulness techniques, but the impact is temporary.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nI noticed that this pattern of thinking and the impact it has on my daily life needed to be addressed for my overall well-being, leading me to seek counseling.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological issues previously.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: My job performance has been inconsistent due to the impact of missing runs on my mood.\nInterpersonal relationships: My relationships with my nephews have been affected by my stress levels after missing a run.\nDaily life: My anxiety about missing a run has disrupted my sleep patterns and eating habits.\n\n6.

They should actively confirm their understanding of the counselor's instructions, ask for clarifications when needed, and willingly provide detailed information about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. These clients make reasonable requests for additional support or resources, and they extend the conversation by building on the counselor's suggestions with their own insights or experiences. They reformulate their thoughts in a constructive manner, reflecting on their progress and expressing a hopeful outlook towards the therapeutic outcomes. Overall, their demeanor is open, appreciative, and proactive in seeking improvement.",
