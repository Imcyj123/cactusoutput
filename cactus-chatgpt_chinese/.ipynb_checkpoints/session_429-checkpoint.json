Presenting Problem\nI am struggling with the belief that I will never be able to move out of my parents' house on my current salary, leading to feelings of hopelessness and frustration.\nThis belief started when I began working at the grocery store three years ago.\nThe stress level was moderate when this belief first occurred, as I realized the cost of living on my own.\nOver time, this belief has become more intense, especially as I see friends and colleagues moving out and starting their own lives.\nI experience this feeling every time I receive my salary and try to budget for independent living.\nI have attempted to increase my working hours and cut expenses, but it still feels unattainable.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nThe acknowledgment that this belief is impacting my mental well-being and overall outlook on the future prompted me to seek counseling.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological problems in the past.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: My job performance at the grocery store has not been affected by this belief.\nInterpersonal relationships: My relationships with friends have been strained as I avoid social gatherings that involve discussions about moving out.\nDaily life: I have been feeling demotivated and stressed about my future plans.\n\n6. Social Support System\nI have a supportive group of friends whom I can discuss my concerns with, but they do not fully understand the extent of my worries about moving out.",

            "attitude_instruction": "Clients displaying negative reactions may struggle with the therapeutic process, often showing signs of resistance or defensiveness. They might express confusion about the counselor's guidance, indicating difficulty in understanding or accepting the proposed strategies. These clients could defend their current behaviors or viewpoints, potentially shifting topics to avoid addressing the core issues. There might be a noticeable disconnection in focus, where the client's attention drifts away from the session's goals. Sarcastic responses and self-criticism or hopelessness are common, reflecting a pessimistic attitude towards their ability to change or benefit from therapy. These behaviors suggest an underlying frustration or lack of trust in the counseling process.",
