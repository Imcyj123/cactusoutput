Presenting Problem\nI feel like a failure because I have not been able to find a cure for my wife's deafness, which has led to feelings of guilt and inadequacy.\nThese feelings of failure started when I realized I couldn't change my wife's condition despite trying various treatments.\nThe stress level was high when my wife's deafness was diagnosed, and I felt responsible for not being able to \"fix\" the situation.\nThe problem has progressed over time, especially as I see my brother-in-law's success in running a major Hollywood studio, which further intensifies my feelings of failure.\nI experience these feelings daily, especially when my wife faces challenges due to her deafness.\nI have researched extensively, consulted multiple doctors, and tried alternative therapies to find a cure for my wife's deafness.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nI decided to seek counseling because the burden of guilt and feelings of failure have started affecting my mental health and overall well-being. I realize I need support to cope with these emotions.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological problems in the past.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Occupational functioning level: My job performance has been impacted due to the emotional distress caused by my wife's condition.\nInterpersonal relationships: My relationship with my wife has been strained as I constantly blame myself for not being able to find a cure for her.\nDaily life: My emotional state has affected my sleep patterns and overall self-care.\n\n6. Social Support System\nI have a supportive brother-in-law, but I have not shared my feelings of failure with him.",

They should actively confirm their understanding of the counselor's instructions, ask for clarifications when needed, and willingly provide detailed information about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. These clients make reasonable requests for additional support or resources, and they extend the conversation by building on the counselor's suggestions with their own insights or experiences. They reformulate their thoughts in a constructive manner, reflecting on their progress and expressing a hopeful outlook towards the therapeutic outcomes. Overall, their demeanor is open, appreciative, and proactive in seeking improvement.",
