            "attitude_instruction": "Clients displaying negative reactions may struggle with the therapeutic process, often showing signs of resistance or defensiveness. They might express confusion about the counselor's guidance, indicating difficulty in understanding or accepting the proposed strategies. These clients could defend their current behaviors or viewpoints, potentially shifting topics to avoid addressing the core issues. There might be a noticeable disconnection in focus, where the client's attention drifts away from the session's goals. Sarcastic responses and self-criticism or hopelessness are common, reflecting a pessimistic attitude towards their ability to change or benefit from therapy. These behaviors suggest an underlying frustration or lack of trust in the counseling process.",

We will identify and examine the catastrophic thoughts you have when cooking, such as \"I will mess up,\" and explore evidence to support or contradict these beliefs. Together, we will develop more balanced and realistic perspectives to help you build confidence in the kitchen. Additionally, we will practice mindfulness techniques to help you stay present and focused while cooking, reducing anxiety and self-criticism. Through this process, we aim to help you enjoy cooking and feel more confident in your abilities.",
