Presenting Problem\nI have a strong passion for cooking, but I constantly feel like I am the worst cook ever, which leads to self-doubt and discouragement.\nThese feelings of inadequacy started during my early culinary training but have intensified in the past year.\nI attribute the cause to my perfectionist tendencies and the high standards I set for myself.\nThe problem has worsened over time, especially after receiving some negative feedback from a cooking competition.\nI experience these feelings whenever I receive compliments or awards for my cooking.\nI have tried to improve my skills and seek validation from others, but it only temporarily alleviates my self-doubt.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nI decided to seek counseling because these feelings of self-doubt are hindering my ability to enjoy cooking and pursue my culinary dreams.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological problems in the past.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: My passion for cooking has been affected by my self-doubt, causing a decline in my job performance.\nInterpersonal relationships: My relationships with colleagues have been impacted by my perfectionist tendencies and self-doubt.\nDaily life: My self-esteem issues have affected my sleep patterns and overall well-being.\n\n6. Social Support System\nI do not have a strong social support system to discuss my feelings of self-doubt with, and I often feel isolated in dealing with these emotions.",

            "attitude_instruction": "Clients displaying negative reactions may struggle with the therapeutic process, often showing signs of resistance or defensiveness. They might express confusion about the counselor's guidance, indicating difficulty in understanding or accepting the proposed strategies. These clients could defend their current behaviors or viewpoints, potentially shifting topics to avoid addressing the core issues. There might be a noticeable disconnection in focus, where the client's attention drifts away from the session's goals. Sarcastic responses and self-criticism or hopelessness are common, reflecting a pessimistic attitude towards their ability to change or benefit from therapy. These behaviors suggest an underlying frustration or lack of trust in the counseling process.",
