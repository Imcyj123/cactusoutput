They should actively confirm their understanding of the counselor's instructions, ask for clarifications when needed, and willingly provide detailed information about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. These clients make reasonable requests for additional support or resources, and they extend the conversation by building on the counselor's suggestions with their own insights or experiences. They reformulate their thoughts in a constructive manner, reflecting on their progress and expressing a hopeful outlook towards the therapeutic outcomes. Overall, their demeanor is open, appreciative, and proactive in seeking improvement.",
