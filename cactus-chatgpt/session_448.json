Presenting Problem\nI have recently started feeling like being good at science makes me a geek and that I am perceived as anti-social because of it.\nThese feelings started when I began high school, particularly in the past few months.\nI believe the cause of these thoughts is the stereotypes associated with being good at science.\nThe problem has progressed as I have been avoiding social situations to not be labeled as a geek.\nI experience these thoughts mainly at school, especially in science-related classes or discussions.\nI have tried to engage in more social activities to counter these thoughts but have found it challenging.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nI decided to seek counseling because these thoughts are impacting my self-esteem and social interactions negatively.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological issues.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: My academic performance in science is excellent, but my social interactions have been affected by these thoughts.\nInterpersonal relationships: I have started avoiding social interactions with classmates and friends.\nDaily life: My thoughts about being labeled as a geek have caused me to isolate myself and affected my self-esteem.\n\n6. Social Support System\nI have parents and a sibling whom I can talk to, but they may not fully understand the intensity of my concerns surrounding these thoughts.",

They should actively confirm their understanding of the counselor's instructions, ask for clarifications when needed, and willingly provide detailed information about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. These clients make reasonable requests for additional support or resources, and they extend the conversation by building on the counselor's suggestions with their own insights or experiences. They reformulate their thoughts in a constructive manner, reflecting on their progress and expressing a hopeful outlook towards the therapeutic outcomes.

By doing so, Nick will be able to develop a more balanced and realistic perspective on himself and his social interactions. This process will help him build self-confidence and improve his social skills. Additionally, we will work on developing coping strategies to manage negative thoughts as they arise. Through this approach, Nick will be empowered to take control of his thoughts and emotions, leading to improved self-esteem and more positive social interactions.",
