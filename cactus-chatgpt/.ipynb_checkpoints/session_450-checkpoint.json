Presenting Problem\nI have recently started feeling like being good at science makes me a geek and that I am perceived as anti-social because of it.\nThese feelings started when I began high school, particularly in the past few months.\nI believe the cause of these thoughts is the stereotypes associated with being good at science.\nThe problem has progressed as I have been avoiding social situations to not be labeled as a geek.\nI experience these thoughts mainly at school, especially in science-related classes or discussions.\nI have tried to engage in more social activities to counter these thoughts but have found it challenging.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nI decided to seek counseling because these thoughts are impacting my self-esteem and social interactions negatively.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological issues.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: My academic performance in science is excellent, but my social interactions have been affected by these thoughts.\nInterpersonal relationships: I have started avoiding social interactions with classmates and friends.\nDaily life: My thoughts about being labeled as a geek have caused me to isolate myself and affected my self-esteem.\n\n6. Social Support System\nI have parents and a sibling whom I can talk to, but they may not fully understand the intensity of my concerns surrounding these thoughts.",

            "attitude_instruction": "Clients displaying negative reactions may struggle with the therapeutic process, often showing signs of resistance or defensiveness. They might express confusion about the counselor's guidance, indicating difficulty in understanding or accepting the proposed strategies. These clients could defend their current behaviors or viewpoints, potentially shifting topics to avoid addressing the core issues. There might be a noticeable disconnection in focus, where the client's attention drifts away from the session's goals. Sarcastic responses and self-criticism or hopelessness are common, reflecting a pessimistic attitude towards their ability to change or benefit from therapy. These behaviors suggest an underlying frustration or lack of trust in the counseling process.",

During counseling sessions, we will work on identifying and challenging Nick's automatic negative thoughts related to being seen as a \"geek.\" We will explore the possibility of viewing his interest in science as a positive attribute rather than a negative label. Through this technique, Nick will learn to reframe his thoughts and develop a more balanced and positive perspective on his identity. Additionally, we will work on building his self-esteem by focusing on his strengths and accomplishments outside of his academic interests.",
