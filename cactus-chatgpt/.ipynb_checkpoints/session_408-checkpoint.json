Presenting Problem\nI have developed a belief that losing at a pool game once means I will never play again, leading to feelings of defeat and disappointment. These feelings started recently after losing a pool game with friends.\nThe stress level was moderate when the problem first occurred, as I value my skills in playing pool.\nThe problem has progressed to the point where I avoid playing pool altogether, fearing further losses.\nI experience this pattern of thinking whenever I face a setback or failure.\nI have not tried anything specific to address this issue.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nI decided to seek counseling as I recognized that my avoidance of playing pool was impacting my enjoyment of social activities and hobbies.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological problems in the past.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: My performance as a teacher has not been affected by this issue.\nInterpersonal relationships: Avoiding social activities like playing pool has strained some of my friendships.\nDaily life: My avoidance behavior has affected my ability to engage in leisure activities.\n\n6. Social Support System\nI have a few close friends I can rely on for support but have not yet discussed this specific issue with them.",

            "attitude_instruction": "Clients displaying negative reactions may struggle with the therapeutic process, often showing signs of resistance or defensiveness. They might express confusion about the counselor's guidance, indicating difficulty in understanding or accepting the proposed strategies. These clients could defend their current behaviors or viewpoints, potentially shifting topics to avoid addressing the core issues. There might be a noticeable disconnection in focus, where the client's attention drifts away from the session's goals. Sarcastic responses and self-criticism or hopelessness are common, reflecting a pessimistic attitude towards their ability to change or benefit from therapy. These behaviors suggest an underlying frustration or lack of trust in the counseling process.",
