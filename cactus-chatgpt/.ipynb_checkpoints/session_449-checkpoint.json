Presenting Problem\nI have recently started feeling like being good at science makes me a geek and that I am perceived as anti-social because of it.\nThese feelings started when I began high school, particularly in the past few months.\nI believe the cause of these thoughts is the stereotypes associated with being good at science.\nThe problem has progressed as I have been avoiding social situations to not be labeled as a geek.\nI experience these thoughts mainly at school, especially in science-related classes or discussions.\nI have tried to engage in more social activities to counter these thoughts but have found it challenging.\n\n3. Reason for Seeking Counseling\nI decided to seek counseling because these thoughts are impacting my self-esteem and social interactions negatively.\n\n4. Past History (including medical history)\nI have not experienced similar problems before.\nI have not received treatment or counseling for psychological issues.\nI do not have any significant physical illnesses.\n\n5. Academic/occupational functioning level: My academic performance in science is excellent, but my social interactions have been affected by these thoughts.\nInterpersonal relationships: I have started avoiding social interactions with classmates and friends.\nDaily life: My thoughts about being labeled as a geek have caused me to isolate myself and affected my self-esteem.\n\n6. Social Support System\nI have parents and a sibling whom I can talk to, but they may not fully understand the intensity of my concerns surrounding these thoughts.",

They might show compliance and willingness to follow instructions at times, but also exhibit moments of defensiveness or skepticism. These clients may provide useful information and participate actively in some discussions, while in other instances, they might shift topics or show disconnection. Their feedback can vary, with periods of constructive engagement interspersed with sarcastic remarks or expressions of self-doubt. This blend of reactions indicates a fluctuating commitment to therapy, with the client balancing between optimism for change and resistance to the therapeutic process.",
